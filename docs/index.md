# Stark and Wayne Codex

The [Stark & Wayne Codex](http://www.starkandwayne.com/codex) makes BOSH and Cloud Foundry accessible to engineers, sys-admins, and operators.  Together we'll describe the process of building an entire Cloud Foundry Foundation from scratch.  But it doesn't stop there, we'll go into how to make it resilient to failures with backup software and monitoring tools.  We'll even cover pipeline based deployments, both in regard to the platform itself and for applications.

Pick your infrastructure and let's begin!
