# Introduction

The Stark & Wayne Codex is a set of instructions and tools that combine to guide you through the process of designing, building and maintaining your own Cloud Foundry platform on a given infrastructure.

To accomplish this we'll be using some tools we've written scripts for, and some tools we've created ourselves, all the while giving full context and directions for how it all comes together.

## What You'll Need

* Decide make a decision about what infrastructure provider to user
create an account for the provider

## What Will Happen

Use terraform scripts to build network, jumpbox, and bosh director for that provider.

Connect to jumpbox.
