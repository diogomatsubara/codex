# Introduction

The Stark & Wayne Codex is a set of instructions and tools that combine to guide you through the process of designing, building and maintaining your own Cloud Foundry platform on a given infrastructure.

To accomplish this we'll be using some tools we've written scripts for, and some tools we've created ourselves, all the while giving full context and directions for how it all comes together.

## What You'll Need

* Decide which infrastructure provider
* Create your account
* Review the network design

## What You'll Do

Once you've picked your target infrastructure, created an account, and accepted or modified the network, you will:

* Build network objects on target infrastructure
* Create a jumpbox to bridge public and private access
* And deploy a management BOSH director

Let's take a look at the overall network design and how we recommend setting up a Cloud Foundry platform.
