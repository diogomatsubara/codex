# Conventions

When reading through the Codex we'll use the following conventions to help keep things clear where we're at.

```
local $
```

`local` refers to your personal computer and `$` represents a non-privileged user.  Whereas `#` would refer to the `root` user.

```
jumpbox #
```

If we're not running on the local computer and need to be on the jumpbox.  We'll see `jumpbox $` preceded a reference command.

```
jumpbox $
```

There are a couple of bosh directors we deploy.  We will attempt to keep them clear by name.  Where bosh/0 is the management BOSH director.

```
bosh/0 $
```

```
bosh-lite $
```
