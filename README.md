# Stark & Wayne Codex

The [Stark & Wayne Codex](http://www.starkandwayne.com/codex) makes BOSH and Cloud Foundry accessible to engineers, sys-admins, and operators.  Together we'll describe the process of building an entire Cloud Foundry Foundation from scratch.  But it doesn't stop there, we'll go into how to make it resilient to failures with backup software and monitoring tools.  We'll even cover pipeline based deployments, both in regard to the platform itself and for applications.

Pick your infrastructure and let's begin!

  * [OpenStack](aws/intro/)
  * [VMWare vSphere](aws/intro/)

## Also Available

BOSH itself and the tools surrounding it take time to learn and gain proficiency.  Then there's the complexity of the distributed systems they can deploy, manage, and monitor.  For more information about BOSH itself we recommend our [Ultimate Guide to BOSH](https://ultimateguidetobosh.com).

If you need an overview of Cloud Foundry, and you're just getting started, check out this Self-Paced course: [Introduction to Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Software Architecture](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-cloud-foundry-cloud-native-linuxfoundationx-lfs132x).
