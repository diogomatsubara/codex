# Stark & Wayne Codex

The [Stark & Wayne Codex](http://www.starkandwayne.com/codex) makes BOSH and Cloud Foundry accessible to engineers, sys-admins, and operators.  Together we'll describe the process of building an entire Cloud Foundry Foundation from scratch.  But it doesn't stop there, we'll go into how to make it resilient to failures with backup software and monitoring tools.  We'll even cover pipeline based deployments, both in regard to the platform itself and for applications.

Pick your infrastructure and let's begin!

  * Amazon Web Services
  * Google Cloud Platform
  * Microsoft Azure
  * OpenStack
  * VMWare vSphere

## Also Available

BOSH itself and the tools surrounding it take time to learn and understand.  And then there's the complexity of the distributed systems they can deploy, manage, and monitor.  For more information about BOSH itself we recommend our [Ultimate Guide to BOSH](https://ultimateguidetobosh.com).

If you'd like to know more about Cloud Foundry there is a Self-Paced course available the edx.org platform called [Introduction to Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Software Architecture](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-cloud-foundry-cloud-native-linuxfoundationx-lfs132x).

## Contributions

When you make a contribution, the changes made to the master branch are pushed through our [CI pipeline](https://ci.starkandwayne.com/teams/main/pipelines/ultimate-guide-to-bosh) and deployed to http://www.starkandwayne.com/codex.
