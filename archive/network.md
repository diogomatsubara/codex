## Supernet

All deployments in this site live under the `10.4.0.0/16` subnet:

```
-[ipv4 : 10.4.0.0/16] - 0

[CIDR]
Host address            - 10.4.0.0
Host address (decimal)  - 168034304
Host address (hex)      - A040000
Network address         - 10.4.0.0
Network mask            - 255.255.0.0
Network mask (bits)     - 16
Network mask (hex)      - FFFF0000
Broadcast address       - 10.4.255.255
Cisco wildcard          - 0.0.255.255
Addresses in network    - 65536
Network range           - 10.4.0.0 - 10.4.255.255
Usable range            - 10.4.0.1 - 10.4.255.254

-
```

That provides **65534** usable hosts across *255* `/24` subnets.

## Network Subdivision

> In general, we will use either `/24`, `/23` or `/22` subnet
> divisions of our supernet.  If the IaaS supports it, these should
> be real networks, with their own dedicated gateways and subnet
> masks.

To support the global infrastructure and several different
(isolated) environments (i.e. dev, staging, prod, etc.), we divide
the supernet up into 16 `/20` site networks.  Each of these can be
further sub-divided into even smaller, deployment-specific
networks (i.e. cf-edge-0, cf-edge-1, cf-0, cf-1, etc.).

## Global Infrastructure IP Allocation

The `global` "site" consists of three zone-isolated subnets.  Inside of those
subnets, we can further sub-divide (albeit purely for allocation's sake) for
the different infrastructural deployments.  Note that these sub-divisions
will not introduce new gateways, netmasks or broadcast addresses, rather
they merely serve to slice up the `/24` networks for fairly small
deployments.

| Deployment | "Subnet"     | #  | Zone | Purpose                         |
| ---------- | ------------ | --- | ---- | ------------------------------- |
| bosh       | 10.4.1.0/28  |  16 |    1 | proto-BOSH director             |
| vault      | 10.4.1.16/28 |  16 |    1 | Secure Vault                    |
| vault      | 10.4.2.16/28 |  16 |    2 | Secure Vault                    |
| vault      | 10.4.3.16/28 |  16 |    3 | Secure Vault                    |
| shield     | 10.4.1.32/28 |  16 |    1 | SHIELD Backup/Restore Core      |
| concourse  | 10.4.1.48/28 |  16 |    1 | Runway Concourse                |
| concourse  | 10.4.2.48/28 |  16 |    2 | Concourse overflow (if scaling exceeds the limits of the above subnet) |
| bolo       | 10.4.1.64/28 |  16 |    1 | Monitoring                      |
| alpha site | 10.4.1.80/28 |  16 |    1 | alpha site bosh-lite            |


Most infrastructural deployments are not highly available, nor even
HA-capable, so they do not need to be striped across the three zone-isolated
subnets.  Vault is the only HA deployment in the bunch, however, so it
_is_ deployed across three `/28` ranges, one per subnet.
